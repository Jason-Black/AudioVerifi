# Audio Verification App

This project is an advanced web application that allows users to upload and analyze audio files for a secret 'fingerprint'. The UI is built using TailwindCSS for styling and GSAP for animations. The application is served using a Node.js and Express server.

## Features

- **Upload Audio Files**: Users can upload `.mp3` or `.wav` audio files.
- **Audio Player**: Uploaded audio files can be played directly in the application.
- **Fingerprint Analysis Simulation**: The app simulates analyzing the audio file for a secret 'fingerprint' and displays the result.
- **Animated UI**: Professional-looking UI with animations powered by GSAP.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for creating the web page structure.
- **CSS (TailwindCSS)**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **JavaScript (GSAP)**: GreenSock Animation Platform for animations.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
